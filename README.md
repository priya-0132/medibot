# medibot
AI-powered Medical Chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It processes medical PDFs, converts them into embeddings using HuggingFace, stores them in FAISS, and retrieves relevant context to generate accurate answers using Llama 3.1 via Groq. The chatbot is deployed with an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time medical Q&amp;A.
